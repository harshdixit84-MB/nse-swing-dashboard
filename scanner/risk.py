"""
scanner/risk.py

Shared ATR-based stop-loss buffer, used by every strategy instead of a
fixed percentage buffer (STOP_BUFFER_PCT).

Why: a fixed percentage buffer is the same width whether the stock is
calm or violently volatile that week. Research on this is consistent --
a 1% (or 0.5%) buffer sized for a quiet stock gets hit constantly on a
volatile one, and a buffer wide enough to survive a volatile stretch is
needlessly loose once things calm down. Scaling the buffer to the
stock's own recent True Range (ATR) fixes both directions at once.

Each strategy keeps its own structural stop level (swing low, EMA50,
support level, etc.) -- this module only changes how far BELOW that
structural level the actual stop is placed.
